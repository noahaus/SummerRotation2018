# SummerRotation2018
a collection of all the various scripts generated during the summer rotation of 2018.
this project involved the possible identification of insulator regions within the genome of
the bladderwort carnivorous plant. Utricularia gibba, or U. gibba, is of particular interest given the previous publication of an 82-Mb short-read assembly. 
Hopefully, there exists a unified insulator concensus sequence, or at least a region that is evolutionarily conserved, which if utilized can assist in the addition of transgenic genes in an organism without the risk of transcription "bleeding over" into other genes.
